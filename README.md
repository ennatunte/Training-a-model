# Training a model for COVID19 predictions
## Description
### Language used: Python
This project is about training an AutoRegression model and using the model for future predictions. The model is trained with 
data from https://koronavirus.gov.mk/ (people infected with the new corona virus COVID19). AutoRegression models are mostly used for
time series predictions. The data from the website is scraped using packages and functions from the Python library selenium.
